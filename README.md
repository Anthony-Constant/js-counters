# Counters

## Introduction

Counters is a simple web page that demonstrates animated counters using JavaScript. It features three counters displaying feedback, sales, and followers, with the numbers incrementing smoothly to their respective target values.

## How it Works

The Counters web page utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a visually appealing display of animated counters. Each counter is initialized with a starting value and a target value. The JavaScript function `animateCounter` is responsible for animating the transition between these values, providing a smooth and engaging user experience.

## Features

- **Animated Counters**: Experience smooth transitions as the counters increment towards their target values.
- **FontAwesome Icons**: Enhance visual appeal with FontAwesome icons accompanying each counter.
- **Responsive Design**: Enjoy seamless viewing across various screen sizes and devices.
- **Copyright Notice**: Displays copyright information at the bottom of the page.
